# CHIP-8
My first entry into the world of emulator development. Some of the most fun
i've had in a while. Written in C++(but mostly just C), using Raylib for audio,
keyboard input, and graphics

# BUILD
Requires Raylib library, besides that it should simply compile with make.
Atleast on any reasonable Linux machine.

# USAGE
./chip-8 <path/to/rom>
