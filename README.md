# CHIP-8
My first entry into the world of emulator development. Some of the most fun
i've had in a while. Written in C++(but mostly just plain C), using the Raylib library for audio,
keyboard input, and graphics

# BUILD
Requires linking the Raylib library, besides that it should simply compile with make.
Atleast on any reasonable(Linux) machine. See Makefile for further details

# USAGE
    ./chip-8 <path/to/rom>
